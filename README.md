# File Organizer

This is a Python script that organizes your files and subdirectories into a hierarchical structure based on when they were created. The hierarchy is organized as follows:

1. Year
2. Month

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Save the script to a file with a `.py` extension.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script using the following command:

python3 organize_files_and_folders.py

or

python organize_files_and_folders.py

5. When prompted, enter the path to the directory that you want to organize. You can enter the name of the directory if it's in the current working directory of the terminal, or the full path to the directory if it's located elsewhere.
6. The script will organize the files and subdirectories in the specified directory, creating a year and month directory for each item based on its creation date.

## Conclusion

This script provides an easy way to organize your files and subdirectories into a hierarchical structure based on when they were created. It can be a useful tool for keeping your files organized and easily accessible.
